							<ul>
                                <li><p>Canopy, Cowl, Fuselage, Motor Mount, Tray Connectors and Wings are displayed. They were printed in Bowden FDM 3D Printer utilizing PLA filament.</p></li>
                                <li><p>The fundamental reason behind this undertaking was to acquire weight stability using PLA filament and gather experience in RC-Aircraft construction.</p></li>
                                <li><p>Initially, the project was begun exclusively and will presently be finished by being a part of University RC-Aircraft Team.</p></li>
